# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: Analysis and tests

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ master, dev/* ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master, dev/* ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "analysis"
  analysis:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      # Setup Java environment in order to build the Android app.
      - uses: actions/setup-java@v1
